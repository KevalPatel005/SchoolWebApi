## SchoolWebApi
### Overview

SchoolWebApi is an ASP.NET Core Web API designed to manage school-related data, including students, courses, and instructors.
It provides various endpoints for CRUD operations on these entities.

### Setup

    - Clone the repository to your local machine.
    - Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed.
    - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    - Run dotnet restore to restore the project dependencies.
    - Update the database connection string in appsettings.json.
    - Run dotnet ef database update to apply the migrations and create the database schema

 ### Dependencies

    - ASP.NET Core
    - Entity Framework Core
    - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
    - Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
    - Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
    - Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson

  ### Configuration

    - Database connection string: Update the DefaultConnection string in appsettings.json to point to your SQL Server database.
    - JWT configuration: Update the JwtSettings section in appsettings.json for JWT token generation.

  ### Functionality

    -Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication is implemented using the JwtBearer authentication scheme. Tokens are validated based on issuer, audience, lifetime, and a symmetric signing key.
    - Identity Management: ASP.NET Core Identity is used for managing users and roles.
    - Endpoints: Endpoints are provided for managing students, courses, and instructors.
        - Students: CRUD operations for students.
        - Courses: CRUD operations for courses.
        - Instructors: CRUD operations for instructors.

  Certainly! Here's a README file for your SchoolWebApi repository:
